## Long-Term to Short-Term Rental Projections - Watershed Properties

### Summary
Access to MySQL database was given to retrieve data on current long-term rental property financials for Watershed Properties. The company is interested in the potential profits of converting some its long-term rental units into short-term rental units through services such as AirBNB and VRBO. The company has a $500,000 initial CAPEX budget and wishes to know which properties to convert and how much cash flow and profit would change for several years after conversion.

Entity Relationship and Entity Relationship diagrams were first drawn in order to extract data from the current long-term rentals and comparative short-term rental data for similar property types and zip codes.
